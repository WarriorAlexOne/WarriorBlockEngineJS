# WarriorBlockEngine

This is a passion-project of mine as I learn JavaScript. It started out as an Atari Asteroids-like game, but now it has become a full engine in the making.

It will feature different features suitable for platformers and top-down games,
as well as having various features such as, but not limited to:<br>
-Screen Scrolling<br>
-Player Screen Wrapping<br>
-Collision<br>
-Death Barriers<br>
-Gravity Physics<br>
-Health and Lives<br>
-Attacks<br>
-Projectiles<br>
-Enemy Spawning<br>
-Basic Enemy AI<br>
-Moving Platforms and Walls<br>
-Speed Physics<br>
-Menu System<br>
-Inventory System<br>
-Level Creation (Both for developers and players)<br>
-World Map Creation<br>
-Progress Saving<br>
-Power-Ups<br>
-Particles<br>
-In-Depth Settings<br>
-Mouse Support (The menus can still be navigated with keyboard)<br>
-And Much More<br>

I'll be adding more as I learn JavaScript, and learn new techniques.<br>
Anyone who wants to use my code, feel free to use it as you will. My goal is to educate people, as I myself learn. There are plenty of comments, and if you use my code in your own project and feel that you've learned something, I'd appreciate if you credited me, though it isn't necessary.<br>

<br>Have fun programming, just as I am.
