    same time.
        -This allows for true same-system multiplayer.

v0.0.8.1
Changes:
    -Changed Shrink Limit from 4 pixels to 8

v0.0.9

        -Triggered by pressing SPACE for player 1, and NumberPad0 for player 2.
Changes:
    -Changed player 2 controls.
        -Now uses numberpad to move. Num8 for up, Num4 for left, Num5 for down, and Num6 for right.
Known Bugs:
    -Sprinting is based on default speed.

v0.0.13
Additions:
    -Added a control guide that automatically appears when the game starts.
        -Can be disabled/re-enabled with F2.

    -Sprinting now uses a timer based system to limit how long players can sprint for.

Changes:
    -Control Guide is now off by default.

v0.0.13.2
Changes:
    -Reverted Player 2 controls back to the arrow keys, with the sprint key being right ctrl.
    -Got rid of a stray 0 in the code that was in a random place and didn't effect anything
    (Kinda regretting the decision).

Changes:
    -Internal code rearrangment to make version changes slightly quicker. Nothing was changed.

v0.0.13.4
Changes:
    -Increased Sprint duration to 2 seconds instead of the previous 1 second.

        -Sprinting causes you to get fatigued when you run too long, and it takes longer to

        -Currently very broken.

Additions:
    -Added a lives system.
        -Player starts with 3 lives and loses a life when touching an enemy.

        -Respawning takes 5 seconds, and causes you to return to your spawn point.
        -The lives are considered "extra" lives, so 0 lives does not make you game over.
        -If a player recieves another life while dead in some way, the player will respawn immediately.
Bug Fixes:
    -Game is no longer sentient. I think...

v0.0.13.6 Dev 14

        -Health system does not work and there are no noticeable gameplay changes.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 15
Additions:
    -Added a fully working health system.
        -The player has 8 health, and losing all health (health going down to 0), kills the player.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 17
Notes:
    -Learning OOP and class files.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 30
Notes:
    -1 of many attempts to get working collision physics.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 31
Additions:
    -First working attempt at collision physics.
        -Colliding with an enemy stops the player from going through the enemy (enemy is only a test
        object. This feature is intended for walls).
Known Bugs:
    -If the player travels faster than 1 pixel, the collision system does not work.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 33
Changes:
    -Completely changed and revamped the collision physics.
        -The player is now pushed out of the enemy at all points, even when inside of the enemy for any 
        reason.
        -The player can still go through the enemy like before, but it pushed out.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 35
Changes:
    -Completely changed and revamped the collision physics again to be more robust.
        -Only 1 side of a wall is detected at a time to ensure that the player cannot move through each
        individual side of a wall.
        -The player can no longer go through a wall without the player position being instantly
        corrected.
Known Bugs:
    -The player is still able to be placed inside of a wall while moving, but will reset to the
    correct position once they stop. This is due to the way movement is handled.
    -If the player moves at a speed that is higher than the wall's size, the player will go through
    the wall.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 36
Changes:
    -Collision logic is now handled with function parameters so it can easily be applied to multiple
    players and walls.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 37
Notes:
    -Messing around with code for fun. The canvas' X size can be increased with C to break stuff. Lol

v0.0.13.6 Dev 39
Changes:
    -Collision logic reverted from function parameters because it broke due to an unknown issue.
    -healthTimer renamed to iFrames (AKA, invisibility frames) internally.
    -Reverted Objects back into Variables temporarily until Objects have a valid use-case.
    -Renamed multiple Variables to have more accurate and descriptive names.
    -Named Variables in such a way that they can easily be reverted back into objects.
    -Changed resolution from 1800x900 to 1760x960.
Removals:
    -Removed multiple unused Variables for player and enemy.

        -Now works no matter the player or enemy's size.
Notes:
    -The start of complete code reworking/rewriting.
    -Started rewriting the walking code. Currently does not work.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 43
Changes:
    -Rewrote and seperated the Walking and Sprinting code.
        -Walking and Sprinting can now be individually disabled interally.
            -Disabling the Walking code also disables Sprinting. This might change in the future.
Notes:
    -The decision has been made to make this game a game engine.
        -This means it will support various types of 2D games (top down, sidescrolling platformer
        ect...).
        -The game itself will still be made after the engine is complete (or close enough to
        completion).

        when clicked.
Changes:
    -Changed Wall code to use Classes.
    -Changed Window Title(browser tab name) to "WarriorBlockEngine".
    -Rewrote Input Code.
        -Not all controls are fully implemented yet.
Known Bugs:
    -Walls are slightly broken.
        -If a player runs into a wall from the top or bottom, they teleport to the left or right of
        the wall, or the player sometimes goes through the wall entirely.

Additions:
    -Start Game has been added.
        -Before you can play, you have to press the Start Game button.
        -The button loads in a lot of game code, such as Players, Walls, Enemies, Collision,
        Text, ect...
    -Pressing F4 now changes the canvas (game screen) position to the right, center, or left of
    the browser window.
Changes:
    -Repurposed the controls screen for debug info.
        -All debug text that appeared in the debug console is now ingame to the left side of
        the screen.
        -Can be toggled on or off with F9.
    -Game Version Number and Engine Version Number are now their own variables, making editing them
    easier.
Removals:
    -"Click!", "Unclick!", "No Click!", "No Unclick!", are no longer shown in the debug text.
    -Removed /*Test Asterisk Comment*/ from the resolution console.log area.
    -Removed the DefValues Object.
Known Bugs:
    -Removal of the DefValues Object causes crashes in this version.
Notes:
    -This version was sent to Robotnik08 in a somewhat broken state, and thus was reuploaded
    minutes later.

v0.0.13.6 Dev 47
Bug Fixes:
    -Re-added the DefValues Object to fix crashes caused without it.
Notes:
    -This version was incorrectly named due to having been quickly changed and sent to
    Robotnik08 for testing.

Additions:
    -Clicking and Dragging the player with the mouse will move the player around.

        -The way Health-Color is handled will be changed in the future.
    -Combined the Block Game JS and WarriorBlockEngine version names into 1.
        -Block Game JS is now known as the WarriorBlockEngine and is considered an engine that

    -The isWalking and isSprinting Object Properties now work as expected.
